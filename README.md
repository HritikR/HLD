# HLD Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the **HLD Repository**, the central hub for all High Level Design (HLD) Diagrams related to our projects. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of architectural designs, system outlines, and infrastructure diagrams that outline the overarching structure and design principles of our software systems.

## Purpose

The core mission of this repository is to foster an open-source community around the sharing and collaborative evolution of High Level Design (HLD) Diagrams. By openly sharing our design documents, we aim to:

- **Promote Open Collaboration:** Encourage contributions and feedback from the wider open-source community, allowing anyone interested to participate in the architectural design process.
- **Facilitate Knowledge Sharing:** Serve as an educational resource for developers, architects, and students who are looking to learn about system architecture through real-world examples.
- **Support Open Source Development:** Provide a foundation for open-source projects by making high-quality design documents available, which can be adapted and used by others in their own projects.

This repository is not just a collection of diagrams; it is a gateway for innovation, learning, and collaboration in the open-source community. We welcome contributions, suggestions, and discussions from all who wish to be a part of this initiative.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories based on projects or system components. Each directory contains the HLD diagrams and any related documentation specific to that component.

## Available Designs

Below is a table of the High Level Design diagrams currently available in this repository. This table will be updated as new designs are added.

| Design Name  | Description                                      | Location in Repository   |
